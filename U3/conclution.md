### CONCLUTION
This game is easy to play but the logic to program it is somewhat complex, we see the game and it doesn't seem so complicated but when the logic is done everything changes.

This program was somewhat difficult but fun because I was learning the logic of the game as well as new functions of the programming language (c++).

What I sometimes had problems with was functions because I declared one type of variable and wanted it to return a different one.

But the declaration of this functions is very important because they help us to give order to our programs, as well as not having so much code in the main function, we would only execute them inside the main function.

I couldn't do the full practice because I also had to do the player vs computer option but I couldn't do it, I tried but it didn't work. But i could try to do it again, although it doesn't count for practice.
