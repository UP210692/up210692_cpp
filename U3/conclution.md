### CONCLUTION

This program was somewhat difficult but fun because I was learning the logic of the game as well as new functions of the programming language (c++).
I couldn't do the full practice because I also had to do the player vs computer option but I couldn't do it, I tried but it didn't work. But i could try to do it again, although it doesn't count for practice.
