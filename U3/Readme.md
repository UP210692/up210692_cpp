# TIC TAC TOE

<img src="./IMAGENES/5.png">

The current program is a representation of "Tic Tac Toe", a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.

This is a game for two players and to play against CPU too. But in this code only can play two player vs player.
